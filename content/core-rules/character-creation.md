# Character Creation

In Book of a Thousand Tales, you will assume one of two roles&mdash;that of a player character (PC), or that of the Storyteller. If you want to take part in the action and experience the story from a first-person point of view, you will do so through the eyes of a PC, and this Player's Guide will help you do just that.

To participate in the game, you will need to create a character, selecting various traits and qualities about them in the process. This guide will help you understand the meaning behind those choices and help you to create a character that you feel best represents you in the game.

Your character represents you in the world. They can be just like you, or wildly different&mdash;they can share your thoughts, opinions, and values, or they can eschew them. Some aspects of your character, like their race, are mostly aesthetic, while others, like their skills and abilities, have implications on gameplay.

### 1. Pick a Race

Your character may be any sentient, mortal race from the Encyclopedia of Creatures.

### 2. Allocate Attribute Points

There are four key attributes for characters in the Book. They are:

- **Strength**<br>Raw muscle and brawn.
- **Agility**<br>Body control, speed, and motor skills.
- **Wits**<br>Sensory perception, intelligence, and sanity.
- **Empathy**<br>Personal charisma and ability to manipulate others.

Starting with a pool of **15** points, allocate **between 2 and 5 points** to each attribute.

These attribute scores are used to determine how many dice you will use for a given roll. When you attempt to use a skill, one of these base attributes points will be added to the number of skill points you have for that skill and the resulting total is the number of D6s you will roll to determine whether or not your are successful at employing that skill.
