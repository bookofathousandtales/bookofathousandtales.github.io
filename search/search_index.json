On Success You touch the tree, declaring it as your Heart Tree and consecrating the immediate area as your Grove. You gain the following trait: Heart Tree You have pledged yourself as the protector of this Heart Tree and its surrounding Grove. On Failure This tree does not accept your pledge. Nothing happens. On a Failed Push You have attempted to claim a Heart Tree that is already pledged to another\u2014the identity of whom is lost to the sands of time. The wild spirits rage at this affront, dealing you an amount of Will damage equal to the number of 1s you have rolled, plus 1. Shards of Amber Will Prerequisites You are in the presence of a nearby tree. On Success You magically draw the resin out of nearby trees. Choose one: You conjure a number of small amber shards equal to the number of successes you rolled. You may fling these shards at one or more targets of your choice; each target takes Strength damage equal to the number of shards you've directed at that target. You conjure a large amber spike. You may fling this spike at a single target of your choice; the target takes Strength damage equal to the number of successes you rolled. On Failure Nothing happens. Sylvan Step Agility Prerequisites You are in the presence of a nearby tree. On Success You duck behind a nearby tree and magically vanish. Choose one: You appear behind another nearby tree that you can see from your initial position. You appear behind the Heart Tree in your Grove, if you have the Heart Tree trait. On Failure Nothing happens. On a Failed Push You duck behind a nearby tree and magically vanish, reappearing behind another tree somewhere in the world at the Storyteller's discretion. Wild Bond Empathy Prerequisites You are in the presence of a wild animal . On Success You gain a trait called \"Sign of the blank \", where blank is the name of any animal in the Wild Lore . This trait has the following description: Sign of the blank This is a Wild Sign. You are a friend of the blank s. They regard you as a trusted ally and will not attack you unless they are mentally compromised or forcibly coerced. blank s can understand the basic intent behind your spoken language, and you can express requests to them and interpret their non-verbal answers to yes-or-no questions. At any given time, you may have a number of Wild Sign traits equal to your WL bonus (WL / 10, rounded down). You may remove a Wild Sign trait at will. On Failure The animal with which you have attempted to bond grows frightened and runs away. Wild Form Empathy Prerequisites You possess at least one Wild Sign trait. On Success In a flurry of leaves and sparkling dust, you take on the form of an animal named by a Wild Sign trait you possess. You gain the basic instincts of the animal (eg. you can fly or swim as effectively as that animal could), and can communicate rudimentary thoughts with other animals of the same species, but you cannot communicate vocally. You can roughly choose your appearance, including skin/fur/feather colors and markings, as long as they are naturally available to a member of your chosen animal's species. Any possessions you were carrying or clothing you were wearing take the form of a small envelope. The envelope is fashioned of papyrus and sealed in wax stamped with an emblem of your choice. The envelope hangs around the neck of your wild form, secured with a simple cloth loop. If you return to your normal form while wearing this envelope, you retain all of your clothing and equipment. Breaking the seal on the envelope will cause all of your clothing and equipment to spill out onto the ground as the envelope vanishes. On Failure Nothing happens. You can try again tomorrow. On a Failed Push Nothing happens.

Sages, scribes, and storytellers the world over are ever on the hunt for new tales to add to its hallowed pages. \u2014 Alhazred, Chronicler of the Abyss In truth, Book of the Thousand Tales is a tabletop role-playing game in the vein of Dungeons & Dragons or Call of Cthulhu. It is story- and character-driven, and strives to reward players with small, memorable tales full of meaningful decisions, fast-paced action, and satisfying progression. To achieve the above, Book of a Thousand Tales implements a game system by Tomas H\u00e4renstam called the Year Zero Engine . If you have played games like Tales from the Loop or Forbidden Lands , many of the mechanics in Book of a Thousand Tales will already be familiar to you. Key Principles The Year Zero Engine is built around a handful of key design principles that inform the structure and flow of games that implement it. Book of a Thousand Tales is one such game, and as such, it carries forward these important design principles, in addition to introducing a few of its own. The Book of a Thousand Tales is intended to be: Accessible The basics of Book of a Thousand Tales are very easy to learn\u2014roll a pool of six-sided dice, you need at least one six to succeed, and the more sixes you roll, the better the result. This simple core is very easy to teach to new players, making the barrier to play very low. Complexity and depth are added piece by piece, offering more choices to the player as their character explores the world. Efficient Book of a Thousand Tales eliminates any and all dice-rolling that doesn't directly drive the action forward. There's no point in rolling to perform an action, regardless of difficulty, for which there is no penalty for failure. Which means the game is also... Consequential Your character's actions have consequences in the world of Book of a Thousand Tales. These consequences are often dangerous and sometimes deadly. Success often leads to a breakthrough in the story, but every roll carries with it some level of risk. This drives the action of the story forward through a series of decisive moments and gives weight to the players' choices. Memorable Your character's actions have meaning, and leave a lasting impact on both themself and the world. There are no classes or levels in Book of a Thousand Tales; rather, your character is the sum of their experiences and skills, and character progression is modelled as growth in those skills and their related disciplines. Your character grows a little bit with every action they take. Free and Open-source This rules text, and all accompanying content on this website, is provided for free, to all, in perpetuity.

How this exactly happens will be covered in detail later in this text, but in broad strokes: The ST describes for the players the setting, including any important non-player characters (NPCs), events, locations, or other relevant context. The players respond to this information by describing the actions their characters take in the world. The ST describes the results of the PCs' actions and how they move the story forward.
