### Grove

_Empathy_

**Prerequisites**

You are in the presence of a nearby tree and not in an existing known Grove.

**On Success**

You touch the tree, declaring it as your Heart Tree and consecrating the immediate area as your Grove. You gain the following trait:

> **Heart Tree**
>
> You have pledged yourself as the protector of this Heart Tree and its surrounding Grove.

**On Failure**

This tree does not accept your pledge. Nothing happens.

**On a Failed Push**

You have attempted to claim a Heart Tree that is already pledged to another&mdash;the identity of whom is lost to the sands of time. The wild spirits rage at this affront, dealing you an amount of Will damage equal to the number of 1s you have rolled, plus 1.

### Shards of Amber

_Will_

**Prerequisites**

You are in the presence of a nearby tree.

**On Success**

You magically draw the resin out of nearby trees. Choose one:

1. You conjure a number of small amber shards equal to the number of successes you rolled. You may fling these shards at one or more targets of your choice; each target takes Strength damage equal to the number of shards you've directed at that target.

2. You conjure a large amber spike. You may fling this spike at a single target of your choice; the target takes Strength damage equal to the number of successes you rolled.

**On Failure**

Nothing happens.

### Sylvan Step

_Agility_

**Prerequisites**

You are in the presence of a nearby tree.

**On Success**

You duck behind a nearby tree and magically vanish. Choose one:

1. You appear behind another nearby tree that you can see from your initial position.

2. You appear behind the Heart Tree in your Grove, if you have the Heart Tree trait.

**On Failure**

Nothing happens.

**On a Failed Push**

You duck behind a nearby tree and magically vanish, reappearing behind another tree somewhere in the world at the Storyteller's discretion.

### Wild Bond

_Empathy_

**Prerequisites**

You are in the presence of a [wild animal](#wild-animals).

**On Success**

You gain a trait called "Sign of the `blank`", where `blank` is the name of any animal in the [Wild Lore](#wild-animals). This trait has the following description:

> **Sign of the `blank`**
>
> This is a Wild Sign. You are a friend of the `blank`s. They regard you as a trusted ally and will not attack you unless they are mentally compromised or forcibly coerced. `blank`s can understand the basic intent behind your spoken language, and you can express requests to them and interpret their non-verbal answers to yes-or-no questions.
>
> At any given time, you may have a number of Wild Sign traits equal to your **WL** bonus (WL / 10, rounded down). You may remove a Wild Sign trait at will.

**On Failure**

The animal with which you have attempted to bond grows frightened and runs away.

### Wild Form

_Empathy_

**Prerequisites**

You possess at least one Wild Sign trait.

**On Success**

In a flurry of leaves and sparkling dust, you take on the form of an animal named by a Wild Sign trait you possess. You gain the basic instincts of the animal (eg. you can fly or swim as effectively as that animal could), and can communicate rudimentary thoughts with other animals of the same species, but you cannot communicate vocally. You can roughly choose your appearance, including skin/fur/feather colors and markings, as long as they are naturally available to a member of your chosen animal's species.

Any possessions you were carrying or clothing you were wearing take the form of a small envelope. The envelope is fashioned of papyrus and sealed in wax stamped with an emblem of your choice. The envelope hangs around the neck of your wild form, secured with a simple cloth loop. If you return to your normal form while wearing this envelope, you retain all of your clothing and equipment. Breaking the seal on the envelope will cause all of your clothing and equipment to spill out onto the ground as the envelope vanishes.

**On Failure**

Nothing happens. You can try again tomorrow.

**On a Failed Push**

Nothing happens. You lose the Wild Sign trait you were attempting to invoke and you sense that the animal you are trying to invoke has forsaken you&mdash;work with your Storyteller to determine what this means for your character.
