In truth, **Book of the Thousand Tales** is a tabletop role-playing game in the vein of Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Call of Cthulhu. It is story- and character-driven, and strives to reward players with small, memorable tales full of meaningful decisions, fast-paced action, and satisfying progression.

To achieve the above, Book of a Thousand Tales implements a game system by Tomas H&auml;renstam called the [Year Zero Engine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJbU3umOMxQB7voJw8dj3UJMnABmON81j9cGxX_JOWc/edit). If you have played games like [_Tales from the Loop_](https://frialigan.se/en/games/tales-from-the-loop/) or [_Forbidden Lands_](https://frialigan.se/en/games/forbidden-lands/), many of the mechanics in Book of a Thousand Tales will already be familiar to you.

## Key Principles

The Year Zero Engine is built around a handful of key design principles that inform the structure and flow of games that implement it. Book of a Thousand Tales is one such game, and as such, it carries forward these important design principles, in addition to introducing a few of its own. The Book of a Thousand Tales is intended to be:

- **Accessible**<br>The basics of Book of a Thousand Tales are very easy to learn&mdash;roll a pool of six-sided dice, you need at least one six to succeed, and the more sixes you roll, the better the result. This simple core is very easy to teach to new players, making the barrier to play very low. Complexity and depth are added piece by piece, offering more choices to the player as their character explores the world.
- **Efficient**<br>Book of a Thousand Tales eliminates any and all dice-rolling that doesn't directly drive the action forward. There's no point in rolling to perform an action, regardless of difficulty, for which there is no penalty for failure. Which means the game is also...
- **Consequential**<br>Your character's actions have consequences in the world of Book of a Thousand Tales. These consequences are often dangerous and sometimes deadly. Success often leads to a breakthrough in the story, but every roll carries with it some level of risk. This drives the action of the story forward through a series of decisive moments and gives weight to the players' choices.
- **Memorable**<br>Your character's actions have meaning, and leave a lasting impact on both themself and the world. There are no classes or levels in Book of a Thousand Tales; rather, your character is the sum of their experiences and skills, and character progression is modelled as growth in those skills and their related disciplines. Your character grows a little bit with every action they take.
