# The Gameplay Loop

Each time you sit down to play Book of a Thousand Tales, you are creating a tale of your own to add to this august tradition. _How_ this exactly happens will be covered in detail later in this text, but in broad strokes:

1. The ST describes for the players the setting, including any important non-player characters (NPCs), events, locations, or other relevant context.
2. The players respond to this information by describing the actions their characters take in the world.
3. The ST describes the results of the PCs' actions and how they move the story forward.

These three steps are repeated until the story comes to its natural conclusion.
