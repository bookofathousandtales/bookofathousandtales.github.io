# Tools of the Trade

You need very little in the way of resources in order to jump into a game of Book of a Thousand Tales. All players will need some means of simulating a six-sided die roll, and player characters will also need a character sheet.

## Dice

As a player in Book of a Thousand Tales, you will have to take risks. Sooner or later, your character will end up in situations where the outcome is uncertain, no matter how skilled they are. Itâ€™s time to break out the dice. Regular six-sided dice (also called D6) are required to play Book of a Thousand Tales. You will need 10-15 of these dice&mdash;if you don't have actual dice on hand, there are plenty of free app-based solutions that work just as well.

## Character Sheets

To document your character, you use a character sheet. In the beta release of Book of a Thousand Tales, this sheet is available as a Google Sheet, which you can copy and modify to your heart's content. For specifics on _how_ to create your character, continue on to the Player's Guide.
