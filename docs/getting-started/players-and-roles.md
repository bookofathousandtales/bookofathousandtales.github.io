# Players and Roles

Book of a Thousand Tales can be played with more or less any number of players, but you will find best results with a group size between three and seven. One of these players will take the role of the **Storyteller** (ST), and the others will portray the main **player characters** (PCs) in the story.

## Player Characters

Each player except one controls a player character (PC). As a player controlling a character, it is your job to immerse yourself in your character. You decide what your character thinks and feels, what they say and do&mdash;but not what happens to them. They may be an adventurer in a faraway fantasy world, but they are still, at heart, a person with feelings and dreams, just like you. Try to imagine: how would you react if you were in your character's shoes? What would you do? The player characters are always the protagonists of the story. The game is about you. Your decisions, your adventures.

## Storyteller

The player who is not participating as a character instead takes the role of the Storyteller (ST). As the Storyteller, you describe the game world to your players, play the other people they meet, and control the enemies they fight. The game is a conversation between you and the players, back and forth, until a critical situation arises where the outcome is uncertain. Then it's time to break out the dice&mdash;read more about this in the "Skills" and "Combat" sections of this text.

It is the ST's job to put obstacles in the players' paths and challenge the PCs, forcing them to show what they're really made of. But it is not up to the ST to decide everything that happens in the game&mdash;and above all, not how the story is supposed to end. That is decided in the game. That is why you are playing the game: to find out how the story ends.
