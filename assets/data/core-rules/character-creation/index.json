If you want to take part in the action and experience the story from a first-person point of view, you will do so through the eyes of a PC, and this Player's Guide will help you do just that.</p>\n<p>To participate in the game, you will need to create a character, selecting various traits and qualities about them in the process. This guide will help you understand the meaning behind those choices and help you to create a character that you feel best represents you in the game.</p>\n<p>Your character represents you in the world. They can be just like you, or wildly different—they can share your thoughts, opinions, and values, or they can eschew them. Some aspects of your character, like their race, are mostly aesthetic, while others, like their skills and abilities, have implications on gameplay.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-pick-a-race\"><a href=\"#1-pick-a-race\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>1. Pick a Race</h3>\n<p>Your character may be any sentient, mortal race from the Encyclopedia of Souls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-identify-starting-traits\"><a href=\"#2-identify-starting-traits\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>2. Identify Starting Traits</h3>\n<p>Your choice of race determines what inherent starting traits you have. For example, all Dwarves have the common trait of Poison Resistance as a function of their inherent biology. You may pick up other traits along the course of your adventures, but these inherent traits are a part of you from birth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-allocate-attribute-points\"><a href=\"#3-allocate-attribute-points\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>3. Allocate Attribute Points</h3>\n<p>There are four key attributes for characters in the Book. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strength</strong><br>Raw muscle and brawn.</li>\n<li><strong>Agility</strong><br>Body control, speed, and motor skills.</li>\n<li><strong>Wits</strong><br>Sensory perception, intelligence, and sanity.</li>\n<li><strong>Empathy</strong><br>Personal charisma and ability to manipulate others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Starting with a pool of <strong>14</strong> points, allocate <strong>between 2 and 5 points</strong> to each attribute.</p>\n<p>These attribute scores are used to determine how many dice you will use for a given roll. When you attempt to use a skill, one of these base attributes points will be added to the number of skill points you have for that skill and the resulting total is the number of D6s you will roll to determine whether or not your are successful at employing that skill.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-choose-starting-skills\"><a href=\"#4-choose-starting-skills\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>4. Choose Starting Skills</h3>\n<p>There are no \"classes\" or \"archetypes\" in the world of the Book. Rather, the agency of every character is expressed through a collection of five skills. Think of these as the sort of ready knowledge you have at the top of your mind at all times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-develop-your-backstory\"><a href=\"#5-develop-your-backstory\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>5. Develop your Backstory</h3>\n<p>None of us sprung from the clay fully-formed—we are all complex individuals with complicated histories. In the Book, every player character has a few key pieces of backstory that help to serve as motivations for the way they interact with the world. They are:</p>\n<h4 id=\"pride\"><a href=\"#pride\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Pride</h4>\n<p>asdf</p>\n<h4 id=\"dark-secret\"><a href=\"#dark-secret\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Dark Secret</h4>\n<p>adsf</p>\n<h4 id=\"big-dream\"><a href=\"#big-dream\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Big Dream</h4>\n<p>asdf</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-choose-a-name\"><a href=\"#6-choose-a-name\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>6.
